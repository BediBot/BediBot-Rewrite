# BediBot Rewrite

This is a rewrite of the BediBot Discord Bot written in TypeScript using the Sapphire Discord bot framework.

## Dev Environment Setup

- Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (16.6.1)
- Run `npm install` in the project directory to automatically install dependencies in `package.json`
- Update environment variables in `.env`

## Running the Bot
- Run `npm run build` in the project directory to compile the TypeScript into JavaScript
- Run `npm start` in the project directory to start the bot. *Alternatively, run prod/index.js using node.*

## Workflow
Do NOT commit to master under any circumstances.
- Open a PR against master and request reviews if desired.
- Squash and merge is the preferred method
- Resolve merge conflicts on local before PR'ing
- PRs without unit tests will **NOT** be approved
